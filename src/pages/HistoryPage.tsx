                During the adventures of Daniel and his colleagues in exile, Daniel is revealed to have the ability to interpret private and unknowable dreams. This earned him a place as the prime minister of Babylon. And later after the Medo-Persians conquored Babylon he was called out of retirement and put in charge of the Magi. Throughout his life God revealed to him amazing and accurate prophecies about the coming Messiah and Eschatology. And to prove Himself worthy of trust God also revealed specific details of the period of time commonly referred to as the "400 silent years" between the Testments. These details are so accurate that many secular scholars believe that the book of Daniel had to have been written afterward. Not before.

And the battles and politics that were fought between the Ptolemaic Dynasty in Egypt and Seleucid Empire in Persia because these two empires trampled Israel everytime they attacked each other.

                                sought to solidify Greek autonomy but were overshadowed by his reputation for ruthlessness, including

            <p className="text-base text-gray-300 leading-relaxed  mt-4">These prophecies also highlight Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who was a ruler of the Seleucid Empire from 175-164 BCE. He is often viewed in Christian theology as a foreshadowing or type of the Antichrist due to his persecution of the Jewish people and his desecration of the Jerusalem Temple. This view is largely rooted in biblical prophecy, particularly in the Book of Daniel, and is echoed in New Testament descriptions of the Antichrist by Jesus and John. There is a lot to unpack here and is tangental to the topic at hand. So, I'm going to skip it.</p>

            <p className="text-base text-gray-300 leading-relaxed  mt-4">The Roman Empire became deeply entangled in the struggles of the Hellenistic kingdoms, including Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire, during the late Hellenistic period. These interactions often led to diplomatic maneuvering, military confrontations, and eventual Roman dominance over these territories. Here are the key battles and events involving Rome, Ptolemaic Egypt, and the Seleucid Empire:</p>

                            <strong>Battle of Magnesia (190 BCE):</strong>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Context:</strong> The Seleucid king Antiochus III (the Great) expanded into Asia Minor and
                                Greece, provoking Rome's interest in limiting his influence in the Mediterranean. Antiochus also
                                supported Hannibal, Rome's old enemy, further exacerbating tensions.

                                <strong>Outcome:</strong> A decisive Roman victory. The battle marked the end of Seleucid ambitions
                                in Asia Minor and Greece. The Treaty of Apamea (188 BCE) forced Antiochus III to surrender large
                                territories, pay a substantial indemnity, and give up his fleet and war elephants.

                                While not a direct Roman-Seleucid battle, Rome provided diplomatic support to the Jewish Maccabees,
                                who revolted against Seleucid rule (under Antiochus IV Epiphanes). Rome used this opportunity to
                                weaken Seleucid control over Judea and bolster its influence in the region.

                                <strong>Outcome:</strong> A decisive victory for Octavian. Mark Antony and Cleopatra fled to Egypt,
                                where they later committed suicide. Egypt was annexed as a Roman province in 30 BCE.

                                <strong>Significance:</strong> The battle marked the end of the Hellenistic period and the beginning
                                of Roman imperial rule over Egypt.

                                    <strong>Battle of Raphia (217 BCE):</strong> While not involving Rome directly, this battle
                                    between Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire influenced the balance of power Rome would later
                                    exploit. Rome benefited from the ongoing rivalry between these two powers.

                                    <strong>Roman Mediation (168 BCE):</strong> During the reign of Ptolemy VI Philometor, Rome
                                    mediated a conflict between Egypt and Antiochus IV of the Seleucid Empire. Rome's intervention
                                    led to Antiochus's withdrawal from Egypt, showcasing Rome's growing authority in the region.

                    <strong>Rome's Indirect Influence:</strong>
                    <p>
                        The Punic Wars (264-146 BCE) indirectly affected Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucids, as both kingdoms watched
                        Rome grow into a dominant Mediterranean power. Diplomatic treaties, such as alliances between Rome and
                        Pergamum, further weakened both the Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms.

            <p className="text-base text-gray-300 leading-relaxed  mt-4">One possible answer to our original question: given this history of conflict between Rome and the Seleucid Empire (foremorely known as Persia). If the wise-men, a hereditary caste of priestly king makers, were going to travel into enemy occupied territory safely. Then they would have needed to travel with a large enough military escort to keep the Romans from attacking them. And the people were troubled by what another conflict might mean for them.</p>
