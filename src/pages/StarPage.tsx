                "Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, <strong>wise men from the East</strong> came to Jerusalem,
                saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? <strong>For we have seen His star in the East</strong> and have come to worship Him."
                When Herod the king heard this, <strong>he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</strong>"
